Complete all of the Unit Tests in this Project (artifact id = MockitoDemo)
using  Mockito.

File MathMockVerfiyTest.java gives an example of 'When' usage
File MathTest.java gives an example of Assert (junit)


The parts to be completed are described in comments within the method , 
and exist on their own line in each file. The comment marks the location wherr
some code should be implemented by you. Typically it is one line of code.

For example in class MathMockAddTest
          //Create Math mock Object
		 // Configure it to return 3 when arguments passed are 1,2
		 
A comment in a line that also contains Java statement is just for 
explanation. A comment outside of a method is also for explanation.

All tests should run. 

Submit one Page report with all of the code (copy code to a txt document )
